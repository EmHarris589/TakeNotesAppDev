# Overview

### Purpose
The purpose of the TakeNotes application will be to keep simple notes, images, and ideas in the form of a post-it note board.  I would eventually like to consider the option of cloud support, allowing this application to be cross platform, however, for the moment I will be focusing on single platform.  This application should allow the user to organize and archive their notes as needed. 

### Function
Much like Google Keep, I would like to create a board (home page) that allows the user to click on an icon and create a new note.  This home page would display all notes relevant to the user.  Notes could have color background options for grouping, and new notes can be text or image.  Notes could also be organized by label, files, or archive.  Google Keep currently only organizes by label - which will display groups of notes flagged with the same label; and archive â€“ a file notes can be sent when the user wants to remove them from the main board.  There is however, no current option for creating files from the main board or within the archive, which I would like to add in this application.  Users will have the ability to add or delete notes as needed.  Additional features that I would also like to include would be bullet list creation, alerts, and the ability to send notes via email.

# Solution Architect Diagram
As this is a very simple application, the actors would mainly consist of: the user, the database, and potentially the site administrator.
